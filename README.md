# Instructions

2. Ensure the email address field has validation to check if the entered text is an email

3. Ensure the password are masked when user is typing

4. The page should be available in 2 languages. Ensure the right standards are implemented when multi language support.

5. No validation of username and password is required after the user clicks on login button

6. When the user click on the login page, it should take them to another page.

7. Ensure the page after the login calls API https://dog.ceo/api/breeds/image/random on load and renders the image that you get as response from the API.

API Response Example:
{
    "message": "https://images.dog.ceo/breeds/sheepdog-english/n02105641_6534.jpg",
    "status": "success"
}
